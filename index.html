      Hainan was my favourite place to go on vacation in these recent years! It
      is a complete change of environment from Canada's, with open beaches all
      around the island's shore. The tropics are plently unique and fun for 5 reasons as they have:
      <ol>
        <li>Sauna-level humidity that feels sweaty even at mild temperatures.</li>
        <li>A hot, hot climate. 35Â° hot, all day and even night. </li>
        <li>Open and very flat beaches that anyone can go to.</li>
        <li>Many tourist sites, like a temple on the top of a mountain that I went to, or the cities themselves.</li>
        <li>Villages beyond the cities, filled with friendly people and a lot of small, family-owned ranches.</li>
      </ol>

      My favourite snack is a freshly prepared bowl of ramen and soup. Although
      it is not the healthiest meal with all of the sodium content, I definitely
      enjoy chowing down on an occassional bowl with spring onions or a bowl of
      fruit on the side.

      Who could go on in life without a good group of like-minded people? A
      small portion of my friends have been by my side for years and years, and
      it is almost as if we shared a single brain cell. spend plenty of time
      with a closely-knit pack of friends, whether that be in person or on call,
      at school, at a restaurant, or at one of our homes.
